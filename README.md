This is a simple REST API built with GO and Gin framework..

It's a todo app that has GET, POST, PATCH, and *DELETE* requests for todos resource

thoughts:

Gin -compared to standard net/http- makes it very easy and straightfoward to define routes and their handlers, and i does a lot under the hood.

Happy coding :)
